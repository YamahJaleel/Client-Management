# Client-Management-GUI



 This Project mimics the data management of an enterprise. 
 For this project we use OOP principles. 
 For starters we declare a class client which contains a constructor 
 that takes in the parameters of last name, name, phone and email. We then create 
 a GUI that allows the enterprise to do 3 things: Register a new client, show the full 
 list of clients and find a client.
